# Sec Buddy - Your new cyber security assistant

This project has been created as part of my studies in cyber security. I have a passion for programming and wanted to make an accessable tool that can parse code in real time to detect potential security threats.
I will be periodically updated this program for the remainder of the year (2023) and hope to have a plugin that can parse:
-Python
-HTML
-C
-JavaScript
-Potentially more, if I have time
