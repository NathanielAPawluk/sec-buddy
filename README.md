# Sec Buddy - Your new cyber security assistant

This project has been created as part of my studies in cyber security. I have a passion for programming and wanted to make an accessable tool that can parse code in real time to detect potential security threats.
I will be periodically updated this program for the remainder of the year (2023) and hope to have a plugin that can parse:

-Python

-HTML

-C

-JavaScript

-Potentially more, if I have time

The current implementation of this plugin utilizes a built-in language server, which may end up getting ported over to other IDE's in the future (this project has been made for Visual Studio Code). This is being built upon the lsp-sample provided by Visual Studio.
